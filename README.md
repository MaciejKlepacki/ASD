# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Overview
This repository contains implementations and explanations of fundamental algorithms and data structures covered in the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course. It includes assignments, problems from past exams, and quizzes. The content is divided into three main parts:

## Part 1: Sorting and Basic Algorithms
This section focuses on sorting algorithms and fundamental data structures.

- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - MergeSort, QuickSort, HeapSort, and order statistics.
  - Linear-time sorting algorithms (e.g., Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort).
- **Basic Data Structures:**
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks.

## Part 2: Graph Algorithms and Data Structures
This section covers fundamental graph algorithms and advanced data structures.

- **Graph Algorithms:**
  - Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS) and their applications.
  - Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall).
  - Minimum spanning trees (Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms).
  - Disjoint-set data structures (Union-Find with path compression).
  - Maximum flow problem (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp).
- **Advanced Data Structures:**
  - Associative arrays: Binary Search Trees (BST), Red-Black Trees, Hash Tables, B-Trees.

## Part 3: Algorithm Design Techniques
This section introduces algorithmic paradigms for solving complex problems.

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - Examples of optimization problems solved using DP.
- **Greedy Algorithms:**
  - Applications and examples of greedy strategies.
- **Segment Trees:**
  - Efficient range query data structures.
